# Countrywise Military Spending Analysis

For my midterm in the Introduction to Data Visualization Class, I had to analyze the Military Spending of countries across the world. 

The objectives of this project were as follows - 

1.	Compare the data to that countryâ€™s GDP
2.	Compare the data to the overall military spending of the all 10+ countries
3.	Compare the per person military spending(sipri) to the per person GDP
4.	Single out the fastest growing countries in military spending in fixed value and in percentage

Note-
Sometimes, ipynbs do not load on github. Hence, the link below is from NbViewer which renders my code & the visual tools.
